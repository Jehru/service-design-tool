# Service Design Tool

This project is a Vite + React application. Use the steps below to run it locally.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or later (comes with npm)
- Recommended: npm 10 or later

## Installation
1. Clone the repository and change into its directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running a Development Server
Start Vite's dev server and open the app:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Vite will print a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) that you can open in your browser. The server reloads automatically when you edit source files.

## Building for Production
Generate an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
The compiled assets are output to `dist/`.

## Previewing the Production Build
Serve the built assets locally to verify the production bundle:
```bash
npm run preview
```
This command first builds the project if needed, then serves it at a local address.
